Title: Grounding of LLM Generated Text with Auxiliary Datasets

Problem: Language models, given a query, may generate plausible but false (hallucinated) information due to lack of ground truth during generation.

Existing Methods: Inclusion of external data or fine-tuning with curated data has been used to address such generation errors, but these methods require expensive resources and additional training.

Motivation: If the models are prompted to further cross-verify the generated information with an auxiliary dataset, the factuality of the generated content can be improved. This approach would utilize the model's ability to reason about and extract information from additional reference material.

Proposed Method: After initial text generation from the LLM, the output is ground-truthed with an auxiliary dataset. Auxiliary dataset could be another large language model with different training data or a specific domain knowledge base. Key facts from the generated text are extracted and checked in parallel against this auxiliary dataset. If conflicts are detected, the text is revised appropriately.

Experiment Plan: The method is evaluated based on the hallucination rate and factual accuracy compared to the baseline methods. Additionally, test the benefits and limitations of different types of auxiliary databases for this task.

Title: Factuality Markers for Reducing False Assertions by LLMs

Problem: Language models often incorrectly assert facts due to a lack of truth-checking mechanism during generation.

Existing Methods: Existing solutions largely involve using external databases, context conditioning or fine-tuning, which require significant resources and supervision while still being prone to hallucinations.

Motivation: By introducing factuality markers akin to HTML tags that indicate the factual nature of a snippet of generation, the model can be prompted to pay more attention to the factuality of marked sections.

Proposed Method: We introduce factuality markers and wrap them around content where the user needs factual accuracy. The model is expected to treat these wrapped sections with higher caution when generating facts. This will be achieved by having the model generate a confidence level about the factual claim encapsulated between markers. If the confidence level is below a certain threshold, the model should admit uncertainty rather than making a potentially incorrect assertion.

Experiment Plan: We evaluate this method by comparing it against baseline models on fact-intensive QA datasets like FEVER, measuring the ratio of correct factual assertions, false assertions, and valid instances of uncertainty. We should assess if the models trained with our proposed method demonstrate improved truthfulness and reduced hallucinations.

Title: Dual-Perspective Validation to Improve LLM Factuality

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating outputs that may seem plausible, but are often erroneous or incorrect, a problem known as hallucination.

Existing Methods: Current solutions include external fact-checking and finetuning models using curated knowledge databases, these however need additional resources or are expensive due to the need for continuous training.

Motivation: A dual-perspective approach, where the model is prompted to generate and verify responses from both a supporting and opposing standpoint, would provide an internal system of checks and balances thus increasing the accuracy and factuality of the model's outputs.

Proposed Method: For any given query, have the model generate two responses: one that supports and another that opposes the argument or claim. The model must then generate verification questions that challenge the factual claims made in each response. By pitting the argument and its counter-argument against each other, the model can self-evaluate the logic and factuality of its own responses. Any inconsistencies detected then trigger a refinement of the generated responses leading to more balanced and factual outputs.

Experiment Plan: Test this model on fact-checking benchmarks such as the FEVER dataset, and a selection of QA datasets with a range of topics. The experiment should compare the proposed dual-perspective model's outputs against those from baseline or retrieval-augmented LLMs. Variables to measure include the factual accuracy and hallucination rate.

Title: Truth-Score as a Regularizer for LLM Factuality

Problem: Non-factual statements generated by large language models can lead to the propagation of misinformation.

Existing Methods: Existing methods such as training large models with fact-checked datasets or filtering false information post-generation have their limitations, such as not being consistent across different tasks or being susceptible to being bypassed by malicious use.

Motivation: Some non-factual outputs may seem coherent to the LLM because they fit well in the sentence context. However, by considering the truth value of each statement the model is generating, we can ensure that it favors factual outputs during generation.

Proposed Method: Apply a regularizer that uses a pre-trained factual-checking classifier during generation. When generating text, periodically pause to apply the factual-checking classifier to each claim made so far. If the classifier scores the claim as highly likely to be false, use the classifier's score as a negative reward to discourage the model from favoring that output. 'Truth-Score' not only promotes the reduction of false statements but also encourages the generation of verifiable facts.

Experiment Plan: Generate text on various topics and compare the rate of false statements between a baseline model and the truth-score regularized model. Use a dataset of verified facts to check the generated content for factuality. Additionally, evaluate the user experience by having human annotators judge the outputs for usefulness and reliability.

Title: Factual Feedback Loops for LLM Quality Enhancement

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) have a propensity to generate appealing but factually inaccurate or misleading content, which reduces their potential for providing useful outputs.

Existing Methods: Existing methods mainly focus on augmenting the models with retrieval systems or further fine-tuning on specific curated data. However, these methods might not prevent hallucinations during the generation phase and often require sizeable resources.

Motivation: The introduction of a feedback loop fostering the model's self-evaluation of its own outputs and proactively correct any factual inconsistencies can enhance the generation process's efficiency.

Proposed Method: The proposed method initiates by producing an initial output for a given prompt. This output is then parsed to identify factual claims, which are fed back into the model as prompts to question the accuracy of the claim. The responses are scored for factuality, and if an inconsistency is identified, this triggers a process of self-correction. The model refines its original output by replacing incorrect facts with accurate ones. This iterative process continues until the factuality score surpasses a pre-defined threshold.

Experiment Plan: Test on popular QA datasets and measure the number of inconsistencies identified and corrected. The factual accuracy of outputs should be evaluated against baseline LLMs and retrieval-augmented models. Additional aspects to measure are the time needed for the feedback loop and the level of factual improvement per iteration.
