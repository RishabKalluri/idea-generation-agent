Title:
Step-Back Prompting for Deep Reasoning

Problem:
Large language models often struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require understanding underlying principles or concepts, instead getting lost in surface-level details and making errors in multi-step reasoning.

Existing Methods:
Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning by generating intermediate steps, but it still operates at the level of the specific problem without first grounding in higher-level principles. This can lead to reasoning errors when problems require deeper conceptual understanding.

Motivation:
When humans face complex problems, they often take a step back to consider the broader context, underlying principles, or relevant abstractions before diving into specifics. This abstraction-first approach helps avoid getting trapped by surface-level complexity.

Proposed Method:
Step-Back Prompting guides reasoning through abstraction:
(1) Step Back: Given a complex question, first prompt the LLM to identify and answer a higher-level "step-back question" that asks about the underlying principles, concepts, or general approach relevant to solving the problem.
(2) Retrieve Principles: The model generates or retrieves the fundamental knowledge needed based on the step-back question.
(3) Reason with Principles: Using the abstracted principles as grounding, the model then reasons through the original specific question with this conceptual foundation.
This approach ensures reasoning is anchored in correct high-level understanding before addressing details.

Experiment Plan:
Evaluate on STEM reasoning tasks (physics, chemistry), knowledge-intensive QA, and multi-hop reasoning benchmarks. Compare against direct answering, chain-of-thought, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Measure both accuracy and reasoning coherence.
