Title: Interleaved Reasoning and Action for Task Completion

Problem: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring interaction with external tools or environments because they generate complete responses without intermediate feedback.

Existing Methods: Tool-augmented LLMs exist but typically separate reasoning from action, leading to suboptimal tool use.

Motivation: By interleaving reasoning traces with actions and observations, the model can adapt its strategy based on intermediate results, similar to how humans think while doing.

Proposed Method: For each step, generate a thought explaining the current reasoning. Based on the thought, generate an action to take (e.g., search, calculate, lookup). Execute the action and observe the result. Incorporate the observation into the next reasoning step. Continue until the task is complete.

Experiment Plan: Evaluate on multi-step reasoning tasks requiring tool use, such as question answering with search and mathematical problem solving. Compare against pure reasoning and pure action-based approaches. Measure task completion rate and efficiency.
