Title: Principle-Guided Response Generation

Problem: LLMs may generate harmful, biased, or unhelpful content without explicit guardrails during generation.

Existing Methods: RLHF and content filtering work but require extensive human labeling or may block legitimate content.

Motivation: By explicitly conditioning generation on a set of principles (like helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty), the model can self-regulate during generation rather than relying solely on post-hoc filtering.

Proposed Method: Define a set of guiding principles as natural language instructions. During generation, periodically pause to evaluate whether the current output aligns with each principle. If violations are detected, revise the problematic section. Continue generation with the corrected context.

Experiment Plan: Evaluate on safety benchmarks and helpfulness metrics. Compare against baseline models and RLHF-trained models. Measure both safety improvements and potential impacts on helpfulness.
