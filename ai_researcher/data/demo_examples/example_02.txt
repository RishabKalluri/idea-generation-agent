Title: Iterative Self-Refinement for Text Generation

Problem: LLM outputs often contain errors or suboptimal content that could be improved with revision, but current approaches generate text in a single pass.

Existing Methods: Existing methods rely on human feedback or fine-tuning for improvement, which is expensive and doesn't generalize across tasks.

Motivation: Humans naturally iterate on their writing through drafting and revision. By prompting LLMs to critique their own outputs and then refine based on that critique, we can improve quality without additional training.

Proposed Method: Generate an initial output for a given task. Prompt the model to provide specific feedback on the output's weaknesses. Use the feedback to generate an improved version. Repeat the critique-refine cycle until quality converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Experiment Plan: Test on diverse generation tasks including code generation, math reasoning, and open-ended writing. Compare single-pass generation vs. iterative refinement. Measure improvement across iterations and computational cost trade-offs.
