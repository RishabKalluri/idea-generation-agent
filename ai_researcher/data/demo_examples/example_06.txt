Title: Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation Based on Query Complexity

Problem: Retrieval-augmented generation retrieves documents for all queries, but some queries don't need external knowledge while others need extensive retrieval.

Existing Methods: Current RAG systems use fixed retrieval strategies regardless of query complexity, wasting computation or missing relevant information.

Motivation: By first assessing query complexity and knowledge requirements, the system can adaptively decide how much retrieval is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency.

Proposed Method: Classify incoming queries into complexity levels based on knowledge requirements. For simple queries, generate directly without retrieval. For medium complexity, retrieve a small set of documents. For complex queries, perform iterative retrieval with query reformulation. Aggregate retrieved information and generate the final response.

Experiment Plan: Test on QA datasets spanning different complexity levels. Compare against fixed retrieval strategies. Measure accuracy, latency, and computational cost across query types.
